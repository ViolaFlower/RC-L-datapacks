## Info
Re-Console: Legacy has to utilize multiple datapacks to achieve accuracy in terms of world gen, behavior and other tweaks. 

These were originally built off of Permdog99's Legacy Reborn datapacks, but have been ported to 1.21 by Panduino and ported for usage in Re-Console: Legacy.

### Usage
- Install something like OpenLoader
- Place the datapack in the data folder
Some of these datapacks have dependencies on mods like Moderner Beta.
